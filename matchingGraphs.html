<h1>Matching Graphs</h1>
<p>From Fall of 2019 to Summer 2021, 
	I worked on a research project about matching complexes of 
	graphs with Bennet Goeckner, Legrand Jones, and Rowan Rowlands. We considered two questions about matching complexes which became two projects 
	each with their own paper.
</p>
<p>
	â€‹In the first project, we consider any given graph under repetition
	 of the jump graph operation. We prove that there are only two graphs 
	 which return themselves for every jump graph and all others either reach the empty set 
	 or grow in size without bound. Our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01796">Iterated Jump Graphs</a>, presents these results. 
	 It has been published in the Rose-Hulman Undergraduate Journal.

In the second project, we characterize all graphs whose matching complex is a two-dimensional 
Buchsbaum complexes. The paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11302">A characterization of two-dimensional Buchsbaum matching complexes</a>
is published in the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics.
