		<h1>Talks</h1>
        I love giving talks and thinking about how to communicate mathematics! Here is a list of talks I have given in recent history.

                <h3>Leafwise Branched Coverings of Foliated 3-Manifolds</h3>
            <p>May 2025; GTA: Philidelphia 2025; <a href="files/GTA-slides.pdf">slides</a></p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> A foliation of a 3-manifold is a decomposition into a disjoint collection of surfaces so that it locally looks like a product 
                R^2 × R. A well-loved example is a 3-manifold fibering over the circle (a
                mapping torus) where the fibers form the surfaces in the foliation. Such a foliation is taut: there is
                a closed circle transversely intersecting all the fibers. In a 2021 paper, Calegari gives a combinatorial
                proof that a taut foliation is equivalent to the existence of a leafwise branched covering. We examine the
                relationship between the monodromy of a mapping torus and the necessary complexity of this leafwise
                branched cover. We are interested in mapping tori of both finite and infinite type surfaces.

                <h3>Modular Multiplication and Dancing Planets</h3>
            <p>May 2025; U Chicago Math Club; <a href="files/math-club-slides.pdf">slides</a></p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b>  Modular multiplication tables are popular objects 
                from recreational mathematics that display fascinating and varied designs. 
                Take m points equally spaced around a circle, choose an integer multiplier a, 
                and draw a chord from point p to a*p mod m. What pattern will appear as the envelope 
                of the chords? We will investigate this question using dynamics, topology, coding, and crafting!

                <h3>One circle to rule them all...</h3>
            <p>Feb 2025; Farb and Friends student seminar</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> <i>... One circle to find them, One circle to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.</i> <br>
                Given a two-dimensional foliation of a 3-manifold with hyperbolic leaves, the fundamental group π_1(M) has a 
                natural action on a space of many circles. These are the circles at infinity of the leaves in the foliation of 
                the universal cover of M. A universal circle binds these circles together and gives an action on a single circle instead. 
                In this example-heavy talk, we will learn how to construct a universal circle for taut foliations and see how universal 
                circles relate to modern research directions in 3-manifold topology.

                <h3>Realizing a Maximally Symmetric Surface</h3>
            <p>Oct 2024; U Chicago Math Club</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> For a genus g surface with g at least 2, the Hurwitz Theorem places a 
                strange upper bound on the number of possible symmetries: 84(g - 1). We will see why this 
                theorem is true by learning about orbifolds and branched covering maps. Then we will study 
                the Klein quartic, a maximally symmetric genus 3 surface. No prior knowledge of algebraic topology
                 or hyperbolic geometry will be assumed, but we will see how these subjects play with each other to understand symmetry.
